# Welcome to atifaiman.dev!

This project is bootstrapped using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Well, you are welcome to inspect my code to your content!

## Initiative behind my website

Well, I would say it is kind of my hobby to code, so I personally attend to my code and my website to improve what I lack in this ever-progressive technology. These code are like art to my canvas, or band to my orchestra, so I love to explore different possibilities. Years into frontend and backend development, I want to see the area in which I can improve, and so this website is built.

## Kind words are also welcomed!

I would like to get feedback from you guys! I cannot recognise all my flaws, unless I do the mistake. And that is fine, for everyone do mistakes once in a while! As I learn through mistakes, I believe I will learn and rise higher. My journey is still at the beginning, so keep me posted on what I can improve!


<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
